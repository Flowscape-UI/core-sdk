## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.3] - 2025-01-05

### Fixed

- AreaSelectionPlugin: fixed issue where a click right after lasso release immediately cleared the temporary group. Implemented one-time empty-click suppression and mouseup-driven suppression flag.
- AreaSelectionPlugin: stabilized lasso behavior when the rectangle temporarily leaves intersected nodes (keeps last non-empty set instead of instant reset).

### Changed

- SelectionPlugin: honors a stage-level `_skipSelectionEmptyClickOnce` flag to avoid clearing selection after marquee.
- Playground (stories): plugin toggles now call `core.plugins.addPlugins/removePlugins` to enable/disable plugins at runtime.

### Docs

- README: added “What’s new in 1.0.3” and a section about Runtime Plugin Management with examples.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-01-04

### Changed

- 🚀 **Bundle size optimization** — reduced from 1.8 MB to ~200-300 KB (6-9x smaller)
  - Disabled source maps in production build
  - Enabled minification for smaller bundle
  - TypeScript declarations remain fully readable
